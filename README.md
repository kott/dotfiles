# Dotfiles!

Note: These are almost a direct copy of [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
dotfiles repository. I made a few tweaks to his to serve my needs.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kott/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### macOS defaults

### Install Homebrew formulae
